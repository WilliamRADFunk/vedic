# vedic
Virtual Environment for Developing Interactive Code

The purpose of his project will be to create an object-oriented programming environment entirely in virtual reality (ie. Oculus Rift). Where an IDE like Sublime Text or Eclipse does in 2D space, VEDIC will do in 3D space. <br/><br/>

When complete, this program will be able to virtually model an SQL database (local or remote). This program will perform the complete CRUD spectrum (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

Separately, this project will be able import a C# project package of files, create virtual elements representing the various classes and their components, and illustrate the relationships between those files (import statements, instantiations of objects, etc.).
