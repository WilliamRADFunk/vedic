# V.E.D.I.C.
Virtual Environment for Developing Interactive Code<br/><br/>

The purpose of his project will be to create an object-oriented programming environment entirely in virtual reality (ie. Oculus Rift). Where an IDE like Sublime Text or Eclipse does in 2D space, VEDIC will do in 3D space. <br/><br/>

When complete, this program will be able to virtually model an SQL database (local or remote). This program will perform the complete CRUD spectrum (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).<br/><br/>

Separately, this project will be able import a C# project package of files, create virtual elements representing the various classes and their components, and illustrate the relationships between those files (import statements, instantiations of objects, etc.).<br/><br/>

The final, and subsequently the most important, part of this program's functionality will be the creation of code in a 3D environment that can then be parsed back into C# where it can be compiled and executed. The compilation and execution functionality exceeds the scope of this project's first version.
