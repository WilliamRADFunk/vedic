	<h3>The Current System: Examples of Existing Features</h3>
	<p>There exists no current system that performs the specific functionality that VEDIC will provide. However, there are examples of software that possess some of the peripheral functionality that VEDIC will incorporate. Among the list of those software examples are: Unreal Engine 4's VR game-making software currently in development, Node-based GUI creation in Unity 3D, and a master thesis by Ando Saabas on how to implement visual languages.</p>
	<p>Unreal's VR programming environment uses two hand-held controls that translate into two laser pointers. A user can move and manipulate 3D objects in a gaming environment much like the 2D version does with a mouse pointer. This software is still under development, and only demo videos are available as examples of how it performs. From those videos, it doesn't appear to add any additional function or intuitive value for the programmer that the Unreal Engine 4 doesn't already offer in the 2D editor. The relationship between these objects is still hidden from view in three-dimensional space, while the node representation available to account for this is still in the 2D style.</p>
	<p>Unity's ability to customize a node-based GUI helps create tools and controls for the user in 3D space. This presents only a fraction of the functionality that VEDIC will give, but may serve to expedite development time by applying it to the VEDIC system.</p>
	<p>The master thesis detailing how to translate an object-oriented language--such as Java--into a visual language, provides a conceptual blueprint on how VEDIC might go about designing its transpiler from typical C# (which is similar to Java in many ways, and object-oriented) into VEDIC's virtual environment, and back to C# again.</p>

	<h3>The Proposed System: Needs</h3>
	<p>The main component that VEDIC will require is access to a virtual environment. This will require an Oculus Development Kit 2.0 as this is the latest technology that is still compatible with all three of our developers' computers. It exceeds the first version by reducing the “screen door effect” and avoiding motion sickness, which is usually due to a lower frame-rate.</p>
	<p>To make this project feasible within the proposed deadline, it will be necessary to employ a graphics engine, rather than building one from scratch. Both the Unity 5 and Unreal 4 engines have VR capability and a large support network. However, all three developers have had some experience with Unity and none with Unreal, making Unity ideal for a shorter ramp-up time. For now, Unity will serve as VEDIC's development environment. It's free version also makes it ideal for the group's narrow budget.</p>
	<p>Later on, VEDIC will require additional hardware for user input. The available options include the Myo Band, Leap Motion control, and XBOX/PS4 controller. At the start, these components won't be necessary until a later phase of the project.</p>

	<h3>The Proposed System: Users and Modes of Operation</h3>
	<p>Users of the VEDIC system will typically be programmers working with C#, though Java could easily be a later edition. These software developers would range anywhere from the novice, learning to program in an object-oriented language, to the experienced developer working on a complex project that involves numerous files and classes.</p>
	<p>VEDIC will have a total of four modes of operation: the viewing of a database (SQL), the creation or manipulation of a database (SQL), the viewing of a program with its multiple files (C#), and the creation or manipulation of a program (C#).</p>
	<p>In the viewing of a database mode, the user will see a multitude of different shapes of varying colors, some interconnected, some stand-alone. These will consist of SQL tables with distinct sections representing columns within these tables. Both tables and columns will be labeled and their colors will be specific to the type of variable they contain (integer, float, char, etc.). Colored pipes or wires will connect these tables where relationships exist (joinings, shared variables, etc.). The number of rows in the table will either exist as a number adjacent to the table's title, or in the relative height of the object in scale with the other table shapes. User will be able to rotate the scene or a specific table, expand a table for better view of its individual columns and possible list of row contents, zoom in and out, explode scene (increase distances between objects), implode the scene (decrease distances between objects), and move through the scene in a flying-style of motion.</p>
	<p>The creation and/or manipulation of databases mode will have user seated at a work-bench. On a wall directly in front of the desk/bench, and within arms-reach, will be a series of shelves with cabinets, bins, drawers, or boxes labeled with the corresponding object(s) they contains with the image of the representative shape(s) on the front (ie. a cyan-colored, flat, rectangular cube representing a column that contains an integer type). On the desk/work-bench in front of the user will be the complex object they are building or manipulating (much like a 3-dimensional circuit diagram). This object/SQL-table will hover above the work-bench and can be connected using specifically colored wires/pipes to other tables and their columns. User can change between view and edit modes at will. This mode will comply with the standard C.R.U.D. array of database operations: database tables can be Created, data can be Read from rows by columns (more easily in the view mode). Tables, columns, and rows can be Updated while any of those can be Deleted, as well. The system will log these in a series of transactions and committed to the database as a batch when user elects to do so.</p>
	<p>Third VEDIC mode is the viewing of a C# project. This mode will contain colored shapes and connections similar to the viewing databases mode. The difference will be the number of different shapes and colors as a programming project has a more diverse set of components than that of an SQL database. This view will share many similarities with a UML diagram, both structural and behavioral, with a third dimension to better illustrate the complexity and interaction that the objects possess.</p>
	<p>The fourth and final VEDIC mode of operation is the creation and/or manipulation of C# files and classes within a project. Similar to the create/edit mode for databases, there will be many more shapes, colors, and connections to add into the 3D circuit floating above the work-bench. These classes, their functions and variables, can be transpiled into an export format when the user elects to do so, and converted to C# files in a project folder for later compiling by user outside of the VEDIC system.</p>
	<p>VEDIC software will ultimately be free to use under the MIT license. It is this group's belief that freely offering the software will promote its use, and bolster its circulation in a shorter amount of time.</p>
